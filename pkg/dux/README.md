# Dux - quack.
*Dux* is a simple framework for creating discord bots in Go. 

## What can it do?
As for now the codebase is heavily developed and there is a lot of functions missing. Yet the simple list can be done:
* Handle commands (duh)
* Support for sub-commands of commands
* Context passing
* Middleware
* It's easy!

## What do I want add/improve?
A lot of things:

* Handling help functions and define custom ones.
* Full flag/argument parsing for fluid interaction with bots in the discord chat.
* Reply when command was not found and provide suggestion of similar command.
* Future improvements of the code.

## When will I add functions?
IDK man, I'm doing my best!
